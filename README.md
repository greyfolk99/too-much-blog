# Too Much Blog (Toy Project)

### 1. Introduction
Actually, this is not a blog app.   
This is just a compose of servers and clients, for studying and practicing things that I am interested in.  
Basically playground for me.

Just like typical new generation code monkeys do, this is:
- terribly structured
- takes alot of resources
- over-engineered or not engineered at all
- over-designed or not designed at all

### 2. Included
Just like typical new generation code monkeys do, I included alot of new technologies that I am not familiar with.
- [x] [client](https://github.com/greyfolk99/too-much-blog/tree/main/client): Next.js server, responsible for rendering pages
- [x] [api-server](https://github.com/greyfolk99/too-much-blog/tree/main/api-server): Strapi server, headless CMS that provides data to client
- [x] [chat-server](https://github.com/greyfolk99/too-much-blog/tree/main/chat-server): Elixir server, responsible for chatting
- [x] Others: db(postgres), redis, docker-compose

### 3. How to run
Do you really want to run this? 
If you urged to run this for some reason, you can research by yourself.

### 4. Warning
This may harm your mental health by looking at the code.
